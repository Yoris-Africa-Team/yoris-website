              deemed not to have the same standards of protection for personal
              data as Nigeria, we will ensure appropriate safeguards have been
              implemented to ensure that your personal information is protected.
              Such steps may include placing the party we are transferring
              personal information to under contractual obligations to protect
              it to adequate standards. If there are no competent authority, or
              existing data protection laws in the country we intend to send
              your personal data too, we will transfer your personal data upon
              obtaining your consent, after first informing you of the possible
              risks associated with such transfer. Where transfer of your
              personal data is solely for your benefit and it is not reasonably
              practicable to obtain your consent, we may transfer your personal
              data without obtaining your prior consent. Other circumstances
              which we may not need to seek your consent before transferring
              your personal data to international companies include: when
              transfer is necessary for protection of the public interest, when
              transfer is necessary for the defence of legal claims, or when
              transfer is necessary for the protection of your vital interest in
              circumstances where you are physically or legally incapable of
              giving consent.

              and other applications, or services (collectively "social media

              the sharing of knowledge and content. Any personal information

              with other users of that social media feature (unless otherwise
              stated at the point of collection), over whom we may have limited
              or no control. We may interact with you through various platforms
              including Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Instagram, etc. Please
              note that any content you post to such social media platforms
              (e.g., pictures, information, or opinions), as well as any
              personal information that you otherwise make available to users
              (e.g., your profile), is subject to the applicable social media
              platform’s terms of use and privacy policies. We recommend that
              you review this information carefully to better understand your
              rights and obligations regarding such content.

              Online identity theft and account hacking, including the practice
              currently known as "phishing", are of great concern. You should
              always be diligent when you are being asked for your information
              and you must always make sure you do that in our secure system. We
              will never request your login information or other private
              information in any non-secure or unsolicited communication (email,

              any financial/account loss or any other loss that is the direct
              consequence of phishing.
